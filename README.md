Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ty, co-founder of WeGoWhere, a social app where people go to discover things to do with their favorite people. WeGoWhere has over 300,000 users in Thailand and is backed by the world's most notable investors; 500 Global, Goodwater Capital, Antler and Peng T. Ong (co-founder of Match.com).

At 21 and 23, I coded, launched, and scaled two profitable startups to 3 million user base. I'm a product engineer, full-stack developer, and UX/UI designer.

WeGoWhere is looking for engineers to join our team full-time, in Bangkok, Thailand. Weâ€™re a small, scrappy team of experienced builders with a strong background in consumer products with relentless focus on our users.
